✈️ Luggage Carrying and Location Finding Robot for Airports

Using Line Following Technology

📌 Overview

This project presents an autonomous line following robot designed to assist airport passengers by carrying small luggage and guiding them to predefined destinations. The system integrates navigation, RFID based identification, and weight monitoring to provide a smart and affordable airport automation solution.

The goal of this project is to reduce passenger physical strain and improve navigation inside airports using an embedded robotic system.
